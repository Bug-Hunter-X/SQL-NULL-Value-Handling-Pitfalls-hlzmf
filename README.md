This repository demonstrates a common SQL error related to the handling of NULL values in WHERE clauses and aggregate functions.  The `bug.sql` file contains the problematic code, while `bugSolution.sql` shows the correct approach using the IS NULL operator and handling aggregate function nuances.  Read the detailed explanation in the bug description for more context.  NULL values represent the absence of a value and cause unexpected behavior in standard SQL comparisons.
